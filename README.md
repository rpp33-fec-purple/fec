  ### Product Overview
* This feature displays the product information related to the selected product as well as the ability to browse through the existing images for that product. This feature will also display relevant information regarding the product including the article of clothing's category, title, price, features, as well as additional information such as slogan and description.
* Upon clicking the expand button on the top-right of the image gallery or clicking on the image itself, the image gallery will go into an expanded view where the image gallery expands the whole screen. Upon clicking on the expand button or image gallery again, the image gallery will go into a zoomed view where the user has the ability to zoom by a 2.5x scaling factor where the image will display an area of the image depending on where the user's cursor is.
* The user is able to select the size and quantity before adding the selected available product to the cart. When clicking on the add to cart button when either size or quantity is not selected, the user will be prompted to select an available size and/or quantity.

  ### Questions and Answers
  The Questions and Answers module allows the customer to ask and answer questions related to the product on display. Some key functionality of this widget includes the ability to:

  * View questions and answers;
  * Filter questions with a search bar;
  * Add a question;
  * And add an answer.

  Additionally, the user may mark answers and questions as helpful, as well as report specific entries. For the customerâ€™s convenience, answers and questions are sorted based on helpfulness, while any answer provided by the Seller are displayed at the top of a list.

  ### Ratings and  Reviews
  The Ratings & Reviews module will allow viewing and submission of reviews for the product selected.  The functionality contained within this module can be divided into several pieces:
  
* Write new review
* Reviews List
* Sorting 
* Rating Breakdown
* Product Breakdown

This component will extend the ability to write, read, and browse through reviews for the current product. 
All reviews will be saved per product.

The core of the reviews component is a list of all reviews for the current product.  By default two reviews will display on initial load.  If available, the user can click 'more reviews' to load additional reviews in a scrollable list.  The user has the option to vote each review as helpful or report it.

Sorting of the list is another key feature implemented.  Sorting of relevance will be the default state, which is a combination of recency and helpfulness.  There is also the option to sort by newest or helpfulness.

For the rating breakdown, the user can see how each product was rated and by how many users it received that rating. The rating breakdown functions as an additive filter, allowing the user to filter for only reviews that received that rating.  Users are also able to see how the product was rated in relevant characteristcs such as fit, comfort etc.
